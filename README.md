##Getting started

###Using cocoapods (the modern way of doing things)


CocoaPods is a dependency management tool for iOS apps. Using it you can easily express external libraries (like Appacitive) your app relies on and install them.
Create a new iOS project in Xcode. Here we've created an app named "DarthVador".

//TODO: Fill when this things goes into the official repo.

###Using the primitive way

Clone the project using

    git clone https://github.com/appacitive/Appacitive-iOS-SDK.git

Copy the source files into your project (Appacitive-iOS-SDK/Classes) and you're good to go.
